      <h4>Slice of Life</h4>
      <p>
        Marco is a current 1Y at Kellogg, he is in his second quarter in the program. Marco has never written code in his life, and he is really excited about how to "make something out of nothing but Lego blocks". He is a big Michigan fan- both football :( and basketball :). He has been playing NCAA Football 2004 since freshman year of high school, and he actually broke the game once.
